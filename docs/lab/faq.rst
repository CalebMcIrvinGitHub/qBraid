How to fix server error?
-------------------------

If your error is one of the following,

- 400: Bad Request
- 500: Internal Server Error
- Spawn failed
- Service unavailable or unreachable
- File Save Error

you need to restart your qBraid Lab server. For these types of errors, *refreshing the page won't work*.
Instead, you need to pull down a new Lab image, which can only be done from the qBraid Hub Control Panel:

Go to **File** > **Hub Control Panel**, or type https://lab.qbraid.com/hub/home directly into your
browser. From there, click **Stop My Server** > **Start My Server** > **Launch Server**, and wait for Lab to reload.

If restarting your server doesn't fix the problem, `reach out to us on Discord <https://discord.gg/gwBebaBZZX>`_, email us at
request@qbraid.com, or `open a bug report <https://github.com/qbraid/community/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md>`_.
